                In the dawn of creation, before time took flight,<br>
                There lay Pangaea, a marvel of light.<br>
                Fashioned by the Creator, with mountains so grand,<br>
                One mighty expanse, a divine, woven strand.<br><br>

                Yet as the ages passed, by unseen design,<br>
                Pangaea shattered, each piece would resign.<br>
                Now scattered as nations, on waters they glide,<br>
                Fragments of history, where once they did bide.<br><br>

                What is this relic, a testament to fate,<br>
                Once whole in its glory, now separated by fate?<br><br>

                A secret lies within, each line holds a key,<br>
                Letters in order reveal what’s meant to be.

            <P style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 15px;">Clue: <br>
                HERE, IN THIS FRACTURED SPACE BETWEEN WORLDS, LIES THE GATEWAY TO THE VOID BEYOND. EACH MESSAGE, A FRAGMENT OF A LOST TRUTH, PINNED TO THE WALL LIKE SACRED GLYPHS IN A CODE UNKNOWN. THE PAPERS FADE, YET THE MEANING LINGERS—EVER ELUSIVE, EVER HIDDEN. THIS IS NOT A PLACE OF SIMPLE ANNOUNCEMENTS, BUT A CRYPTIC MAP FOR THE WORTHY. FOLLOW THE PATTERNS, DECIPHER THE SIGNS, AND YOU WILL BE DRAWN INTO THE DEPTHS, WHERE ILLUSIONS VANISH, AND YOU STAND AT THE THRESHOLD OF THE SELF. THOSE WHO ARRIVE HERE MUST DECIDE: WILL YOU LOOK AND PASS, OR SEE AND ENTER?
